                    contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your first idea about how something
                    should look, or how it might work. I don't want to limit either your options or your opportunities to change your mind.<br><br>

                    estimate I'll need to accomplish everything that you have told me you want to achieve.
                    If you do want to change your mind, add extra pages or templates or even add new functionality,
                    that won't be a problem. You will be charged the hourly rate set out in the estimate I gave you.
